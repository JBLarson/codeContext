### LLM Prompt Generation Tool

Easily generate LLM prompts that include relevant files from the project you're working on.

#### If you'd like to use the tool on a private GitHub repo

- Create a personal access token (PAT) with READ-ONLY privileges on the private repo in question.
- Add that personal access token to the token.js file

//token.js

const GITHUB_TOKEN = 'YOUR-TOKEN';
